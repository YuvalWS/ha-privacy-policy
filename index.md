# yuweiss smart home

Welcome! I design and build custom smart-enabled devices for personal use, primarily based on ESP32 microcontrollers. My projects include sensors, switches, and other smart home components tailored for my own environment.

I am working to integrate these devices with Google Home and Home Assistant, and exploring support for the Matter protocol to ensure compatibility and future-proofing.

- All devices and integrations are for personal, non-commercial use.
- No user data is stored, shared, or sold to any third parties.
- All data transmitted is used solely for the purpose of controlling and querying my own smart home devices.
